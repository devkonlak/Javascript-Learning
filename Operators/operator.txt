JavaScript Assignment Operators:

Operator	Example	         Same As
=	        x = y	         x = y
+=	        x += y	         x = x + y
-=	        x -= y	         x = x - y
*=	        x *= y	         x = x * y
/=	        x /= y	         x = x / y
%=	        x %= y	         x = x % y
**=	        x **= y	         x = x ** y

Shift Assignment Operators:

Operator	Example	      Same As
<<=	        x <<= y	      x = x << y
>>=	        x >>= y	      x = x >> y
>>>=        x >>>= y      x = x >>> y

1. Assignment Operator (=)
The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
Example:

let x = 5; // Assigns the value 5 to the variable x
let y = "Hello"; // Assigns the string "Hello" to the variable y


2. Equality Operator (==)
The == operator is used to compare two values for equality, but it performs type coercion. This means that if the values are of different types, JavaScript will try to convert them to the same type before making the comparison.

Example:
console.log(5 == "5"); // true, because "5" is converted to 5 before comparison
console.log(0 == false); // true, because false is converted to 0 before comparison
console.log(null == undefined); // true, because null and undefined are considered equal
console.log(1 == true); // true, because true is converted to 1 before comparison


3. Strict Equality Operator (===)
The === operator is used to compare two values for equality without performing type coercion. This means that the values must be of the same type and have the same value to be considered equal.

Example:
console.log(5 === "5"); // false, because the types are different (number vs string)
console.log(0 === false); // false, because the types are different (number vs boolean)
console.log(null === undefined); // false, because the types are different
console.log(1 === true); // false, because the types are different (number vs boolean)
console.log(5 === 5); // true, because both the value and the type are the same
console.log("hello" === "hello"); // true, because both the value and the type are the same
