..JavaScript Variables:
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.


In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
let x;
x = 6;

..JavaScript Operators:

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values.

..JavaScript Expressions:

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

5 * 10 => 5 * 10 evaluates to 50
x * 10 => Expressions can also contain variable values.
"John" + " " + "Doe" => The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

..JavaScript Comments:

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.


..JavaScript Identifiers / Names:

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

..The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables.

..Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

..Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

..Lower Camel Case:

..JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

..firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
